medical image segmentation
Deep auto-encoder-decoder network for medical image segmentation with state of the art results on skin lesion segmentation, lung segmentation, and retinal blood vessel segmentation. This method applies bidirectional convolutional LSTM layers in U-net structure to non-linearly encode both semantic and high-resolution information with non-linearly technique. Furthermore, it applies densely connected convolution layers to include collective knowledge in representation and boost convergence rate with batch normalization layers.
